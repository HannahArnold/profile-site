                    Hello my name is Hannah Arnold, i am 21 years old and currently taking a programming course at the digital academy.
                    my current goal is to get an apprenticeship with a company within Cambridge. One of my favourite things is to play 
                    video games on my pc at home, which I have built and opening up laptops and games consoles to see inside them. One of the 
                    reasons why i started coding is because i have always been facinated by how programs run and have always wanted to
                    see how they run and eventually make my own game/program that works. I am comfortable with both hardware and software.
